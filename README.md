A simple, lightweight Android application designed to run a timer with an automatic reset option, perfect for interval training, productivity sessions like the Pomodoro technique, or any activity requiring repeated timing cycles.

The app's front-end is built with clean, responsive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's all powered by a native Android WebView wrapper.
